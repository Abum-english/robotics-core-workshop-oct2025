Real World Robotics
====================================

Wayforward Weekends
-------------------

**Theme:** *Wayforward Weekends* — every two weeks, we step outside of pure robotics 
and focus on the bigger picture: your academic journey, professional growth, 
and career strategy. These sessions happen on **Saturday or Sunday evenings**, 
giving students a chance to interact, reflect, and plan their future.

**Focus**

- Sharing personal experiences on **Master’s and PhD applications**:

  - How I prepared my Erasmus Mundus and other academic applications.
  - Choosing programs, writing statements of purpose, and preparing recommendation letters.
  - Finding scholarships and fellowships in robotics, AI, and engineering.

- Support **career-oriented participants**:

  - **CV reviews** tailored for industry and academia.
  - Writing effective **cover letters** and **motivation letters**.
  - **Upwork and freelancing strategies**: finding gigs, writing proposals, pricing jobs.
  - **Self-branding**: LinkedIn presence, GitHub portfolios, personal websites.

- Create a supportive environment for students to ask real questions about:

  - Career direction
  - Graduate school
  - Research opportunities
  - Freelancing and entrepreneurship
