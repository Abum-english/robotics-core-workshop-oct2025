Code, Commit, Conquer (Git & GitHub Essentials)
=======================================================

**Theme:** *Code, Commit, Conquer* 

This week equips participants with the essential
skills to manage their robotics projects using **Git** and **GitHub**.  
From version control basics to building a projects portfolio, students
learn how to collaborate, track changes, and showcase their work.

Focus
-----

- Understand the basics of **Git**: repositories, commits, branches, merges.
- Learn how to use **GitHub** to host projects, track progress, and collaborate.
- Set up GitHub repositories for workshop assignments.
- Learn professional workflows used in open-source and industry projects.

Learning Flow
-------------

1. **Theory**
   - Why version control is critical in robotics and software engineering.
   - Git vs GitHub: local version control vs remote hosting.
   - Core concepts:
     
     - Repository (repo)
     - Staging area
     - Commits
     - Branching and merging
     - Pull requests

2. **Practical / Code**
   - Install Git and configure user identity.
   - Create a new local repository.
   - Track changes with `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status`.
   - Push a project to GitHub with `git remote` and `git push`.
   - Clone a repo and contribute changes.
   - Resolve basic merge conflicts.
   - Write meaningful commit messages.

3. **Collaboration & Professional Practice**
   - Forking and pull requests (PRs).
   - Using issues and GitHub Projects to track tasks.
   - Writing good READMEs and documentation.
   - Adding badges and visuals for presentation.
   - Importance of consistent commit history for career portfolios.

4. **Assignment**
   - Initialize a GitHub repository for your robotics workshop assignments.
   - Create at least:
     
     - 5 meaningful commits
     - 1 branch (feature branch) merged back into main
     - A well-structured README with project description and usage
   - Submit the repository link for review.

Takeaway
--------

By the end of this week, students will not only understand how to use 
**Git and GitHub effectively**, but will also have the beginnings of a 
**professional portfolio**.  
Every assignment and project will contribute to their GitHub activity, 
creating a track record that is invaluable for both **academic applications** 
and **career opportunities**.
