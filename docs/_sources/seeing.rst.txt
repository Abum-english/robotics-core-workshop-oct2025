Seeing is Believing
==================================================

**Theme:** *Seeing is Believing* — this week we dive into **RViz2** and **Gazebo**, 
where theory and code come alive through visualization and simulation.

Focus
-----

- Learn the difference between **visualization (RViz2)** and **simulation (Gazebo)**.
- Understand why robotics engineers simulate before building.
- URDF Basics
- Import 3D models 
- Robot visualization
- Robot simulation
- Map and World Building

Learning Flow
-------------

1. **Theory**
   - Why simulation is critical in robotics.
   - Visualization vs. simulation.
   - Introduction to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).
   - Digital twin concepts in robotics.

2. **Practical / Code**
- Write a basic URDF for a simple robot.
   - Import 3D models into Gazebo.
   - Visualize frames, sensors, and trajectories in RViz2.
   - Move a robot in simulation and observe transforms + states in RViz.
   - Launch a robot simulation in Gazebo.
   - Create a simple custom world with obstacles and free space.
   - Launch a robot model in **Gazebo**.

3. **Assignment**
   - Load a robot 
   - Visualize sensors and coordinate frames in **RViz2**.
   - Write a short README explaining how simulation matches theory.

Takeaway
--------

By the end of this week, students will understand how to move from 
**robot descriptions (URDF)** to **visualization (RViz2)** and 
**simulation (Gazebo)**. They will be able to create simple robots, 
visualize their states, and place them in custom worlds — proving that 
in robotics, truly, *Seeing is Believing*.
